        <p>A passive electrical component that resists the passage of electricity is called a resistor. They are present in practically all electronic circuits and electrical networks. Ohms (Î©) are used to measure resistance. The resistance that develops when a resistor with a one volt (V) drop across its terminals experiences a current of one ampere (A). This resistance is known as an ohm. The voltage across the terminal ends determines how much current flows through them. Ohm's law is a representation of this ratio: R = V I There are numerous uses for resistors. Limiting electric current, voltage division, heat production, matching and loading circuits, gain control, and time constant setting are a few instances. They have resistance levels spanning more than nine orders of magnitude that are commercially available.</p>

It is an American trade group that stands for producers of medical imaging systems and electrical equipment. NEMA offers a platform for the development of technical standards, public policy advocacy, and market research pertaining to the electrical sector. Electrical items such as wire devices, motors, lighting, transformers, medical imaging equipment, and more are covered by NEMA standards. The design, production, and usage of electrical devices are made safer, more efficient, and more interoperable thanks to these standards.</p>
